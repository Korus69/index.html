      <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
      <h2 class="lesson-title">Chess Lesson for Beginner: Learning Piece Notations and Squares</h2>
      <img src="images/chessboard.jpg" alt="Chess Board" class="chess-image">
      <p>Take a look at this chess board. This is where all the action happens, in total there are 64 squares, from the left to right notation as: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and from bottom to top, counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. These notations will be very useful in next coming lessons because I am going to talk in chess notations and this helps to make learning process easier to the beginners. For example: The white king is on e1 and black king is on e8 square. Similarly, if I want to move a pawn on e2, to e4, this move would now be called as "e4". If I want to move my knight to f3, this move would be denoted as "Nf3".</p>

      <p>Here are all the notations for every piece, remember that pawns do not have notation and whichever square pawn moves to, we are going to name that square only: Here's the list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>King - notation - K</li>
        <li>Queen - notation - Q</li>
        <li>Bishop - notation - B</li>
        <li>Knight - notation - N</li>
        <li>Rook - notation - R</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now for example, imagine a pawn is on e4 and another pawn is on d5, if someone captured this pawn, the notation would now be "exd5", where "x" or cross symbolizes something captured something, if Queen captured rook, "Qxr", etc.. so on. Even though the move has not happened in the board, you should be able to imagine it, this helps in your calculation of the move sequence. But more on that later at advanced level lessons.</p>

      <p>Now that you have learned about notations of squares and pieces, let's move on to the next lesson, where I will show you how to begin the game with a beginner-friendly opening.</p>

      <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
      <h2 class="lesson-title">Opening Concept and How to Learn Any Opening</h2>
      <img src="images/chessopening1.jpg" alt="Opening Diagram" class="chess-image">
      <p>I am sure you have mastered Lesson 1, and here you have arrived at Lesson 2. Now that you have learnt all the notations of pieces and squares, I will tell you about new notation, which is castling. Castling is the move of King and the adjacent Rook, as soon as the knight and bishop between King and the Rook are out or developed, then King and Rook can perform shuffling and can castle. The third image on above figure shows how King and Rook are positioned for both black and white after castling. So, the notation of castling is O-O, and if you want to castle queenside, for which the Knight, Bishop and the Queen needs to get out of the way, the King and Rook could castle longer side, which would be notation wise O-O-O.</p>

      <p>Here in the above picture, one opening has been played out with the starting move of 1.D4 D5, where d pawn of both black and white moved. And on the second Move, the white has moved its bishop to square of f4, which can be denoted as "Bf4", so then the full opening was played out as :<br/>
      1. D4 D5<br/>
      2. Bf4 e6<br/>
      3. e3 Nf6<br/>
      4. Nf3 c6<br/>
      5. Bd3 Be7<br/>
      6. O-O , O-O</p>

      <img src="images/chessopeningone1final.jpg" alt="London Position" class="chess-image">

      <p>Now look at this position on this board, which is played out by six moves of both black and white mentioned above. This position is called "London System" in general and 1.d4 d5, 2Bf4 ... is called as Hyper-Accelerated London system, because Bishop came out early, and it is a safe and easy system to play for beginners to get a comfortable position in the opening phase of a chess game. The thematic idea of London system is the bishop on d3 square, which stays in long diagonal and later Queen can go to c2 square and reinforce the bishop. </p>

      <p>So if you want to learn any opening, play that line repeatedly against an engine or a friend. Make notes and try to understand the ideas behind moves. This way you can learn many openings easily. In summary, Opening phase is where you developed your pieces, and castled and got a position of your liking. In the next lesson, I will teach you about middle game concepts.</p>

      <h1>Lesson 3</h1>
      <h2 class="lesson-title">Middle Game Plan and Learning the Imbalances</h2>
      
      <p>Welcome to middlegame phase of the game. I am sure you have learnt what an opening means by now. Opening's motive was to get a player started, develop their pieces and finally castle their King to safety. But now that this is done, what next ? Exactly, this is where we will learn about middlegame phase of the game. Here are the main points of middlegame phase of the game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Middlegame is where you plan your next moves to gain advantage</li>
        <li>Advantage of any player can be because of : Space, Tactics, Properly placed pieces ( Active and Passive pieces), Pawn structure, Positional weaknesses, weak square, weak pawns, etc.</li>
        <li>Middlegame phase is when you are going to attack your opponent's weak pawns, and place your piece in the weak squares.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Take a look at following position on the board</p>
      <img src="images/lesson3pic1.jpg" alt="Middlegame position example" class="chess-image" style="max-width: 300px;"/>

      <p>Now take a look at this position, this may look normal, and yes here the opening just ended and now this game is at middlegame phase. But black has gone wrong and white is completely winning. Can you spot why? This is because Black has created huge weakness on his king side, look at this pawn on h6. It is capturable. But aren't you giving up a bishop for it? What happens after he takes, I guess we will take with Queen, and the light square bishop is eyeing on the h7 square, and this game is all over after you sacrifice your dark square bishop, takes and queen takes. This example is a tactical weakness of black and white has managed to punish black for it.</p>

      <p>Take a look at following images</p>
      <img src="images/lesson3pic2.jpg" alt="Middlegame tactical example 1" class="chess-image" style="max-width: 300px; margin-bottom: 2rem;"/>
      <img src="images/lesson3pic3.jpg" alt="Middlegame tactical example 2" class="chess-image" style="max-width: 300px;"/>

      <p>Now take a look at different image below, this is a position played by Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik in 1997, and here white to move and avoid any exchanges</p>
      <img src="images/lesson3pic4.jpg" alt="Kramnik 1997 position" class="chess-image" style="max-width: 350px;"/>

      <p>In this position above, black is lost, because white has managed to get a lot of space for himself. The game started with these following moves : 1.d4 Nf6 , 2.c4 c5, 
      3. d5 e6, 4. Nc3 exd5, 5. cxd5 d6, 6. e4 g6, 7. f4 Bg7, 8. Bb5 +Nfd7 , 9. a4 O-O, 10. Nf3 Nb4 , 
      11. O-O Nb4, 12. Re1 a6,  13 ..... ....... ?</p>

      <p>White enjoys much more central space. Note that black's light square bishop is actually in the way of other pieces. At the moment, white's light squared bishop is under attack by pawn on a6 and has to move.  13. Bc4 has been played from time to time in this game, but 13. Bf1 is correct. Why? Because 1. Bc4 gives black time to free his bishop and trade it off 13. ....Nb6 , 14. Be2 Bg4. When black's force will have more room to move about. </p>

      <p>But on the other hand, if 13. Bf1 is played, then it avoids this Nf6 move of black, when black is forced to continue suffering the lack of space for his pieces. This idea that the side with more territory or space should avoid unnecessary exchanges / trade off of pieces and might lead one to believe that space won't be much use in endgame since many exchanges would have been made to reach that stage. However, this simple is not the case. And the side with more space almost always has the advantage.</p>

      <p>You have learnt about how a side with piece activity, space, tactical advantage, better pawn structures , always have the advantage, to achieve it, is the motive of middlegame phase of the game. In the next lesson, we will talk about middle game and endgame imbalances.</p>
